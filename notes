make lexicon for alphabet 
	this will contain a list of keywords that will 
	be in our program 
	
make lexicon for symbols
	this iwll contain a list of symbols that will
	be in our program 


these two will be text files 
	or maybe data structures 

we can start by using these to test if something is syntaxically correct 

we can develop this more by establishing a grammar 
		sentence structures for using the keywords and symbols
